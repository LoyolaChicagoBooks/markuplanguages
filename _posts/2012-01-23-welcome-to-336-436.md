Welcome to the new course web site for COMP 336-436, Markup Languages and
Applications.

I believe most of the content has been migrated successfully from the
[old site](http://markup.etl.luc.edu). Soon this site will become the
permanent one. After a short period the old site will be deleted.

If you discover anything that is missing, please do report it to me immediately
at [gkt@cs.luc.edu](mailto:gkt@cs.luc.edu). Thanks!
