Homework #3 is going to be a bit more free form than the two previous assignments.

For this assignment, you will be developing a schema, sample documents, and transformer (to XHTML) for a fictitious language called TopicML.

In recent months, I have been interested in a topic that I think is near and dear to your hearts. It has to do with education at all levels: curriculum mapping and traversal.

I'm going to give a couple of examples:
What would be a good 4-year plan for me to consider as a student in the BS CS program? What if I want to do the BS IT? 
In what courses would I learn about graph data structures?
Show me all of the classes for which I have the correct prerequisites.
Here are some areas where we could explore the application of this kind of markup language:
Common Core State Standards for Education
CS Department Courses/Prerequisites and Schedules
ACM Computing Curricula
At some level, a TopicML is a graph data structure but also needs much of the machinery of lists and trees (mainly for grouping purposes). In addition, such a language would have much in common with a number of outlining formats (see OML).

Your job is going to be twofold. You will begin by surveying the landscape to determine what languages exist that already do the same thing as TopicML. Then you will find an example of something that needs to be organized in a topical way (the examples above are a good start) and either create your own markup language or extend an existing markup language to support topics that depend on other topics, groups of topics. You will demonstrate that you can sort the topics--topologically--into proper order. This will depend heavily on what example you have chosen, either from the above list of possibilities or something else that needs this framework.
