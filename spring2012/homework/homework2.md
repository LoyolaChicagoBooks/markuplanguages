**This homework has not been assigned yet. The text you see here is from the previous offering and is subject to change.**

In our first homework assignment we basically considered how to build a book "the hard way" by using HTML to author the book. You might be inclined to think that nobody builds books this way and you'd be right to a certain extent. Most folks author books using Microsoft Word, Open Office or a professional typesetting system such as LaTeX (your professor uses it for technical writing). But in some ways there is a step "backwards" happening in the industry. Web-based word processors (Google, Zoho, and Microsoft) all in one way or another use HTML as the document model, given that native DOM support is provided for it in the web browser. Without going into all of its limitations here, suffice it to say you have learned in the first assignment that creating a book using HTML is both easy and hard. It is easy to author HTML itself. However, many structural and styling issues come to the forefront very quickly in the authoring process. There is no better case for XML than to separate structural (content) from presentation (styling). We're going to be learning about all of these aspects in the coming weeks, so let's get started!
Details
In this assignment, you will learn to use an XML-based language, DocBook, to create a version of your book in XML. To do so, you will need to read about DocBook. (Yes, you'll be learning the essentials on your own.) You will not be producing actual HTML at this stage--just XML--but it is fairly easy to do so in both OxygenXML and LyX (an editor for both LaTeX and DocBook projects). I recommend not using these tools at this stage. To make this assignment interesting, you must make sure to place your document content in multiple files and make sure that the document validates against the DocBook DTD (Document Type Definition). Ideally, there should be as many "source files" in this assignment as in Homework 1.

To give you a bit of a hint, there are ways to author DocBook with an editor, including the OxygenXML editor that we are using for class. There is actually a sample included with the OxygenXML editor that shows how to use V5. Of course, it takes advantage of many features that you likely did not use in your first assignment, and it is entirely possible that there are features from your first assignment that are not being used (e.g. contents, index, etc.) So the lowdown is that you're going to need to figure out how DocBook works no matter what.

To repeat: I recommend that everyone start by trying to learn the basics of DocBook from scratch and using the reference manual to find out how to use features that are needed to reproduce the results from Homework 1.

As you know, in our previous class (1/25; 2/1 snowed out) we discussed Homework 1 approaches. We'll do the same thing on February 8th, so the hope is that several of you will come prepared to present your work in class.

Finally, as before, all work must be submitted using Bitbucket.org. It is my hope that you will use the same repository for this current project. You may want to create folders for each of the homework assignments (e.g. homework1, homework2, etc.)
